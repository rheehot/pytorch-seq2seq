## Intro
  
This is a framework for Attention based Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) models implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Installation
This project recommends Python 3.7 or higher.   
I recommend creating a new virtual environment for this project (using virtualenv or conda).  

### Prerequisites
  
* Numpy: `pip install numpy` (Refer [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) for problem installing Numpy).
* PyTorch: Refer to [PyTorch website](http://pytorch.org/) to install the version w.r.t. your environment.
  
## Troubleshoots and Contributing
If you have any questions, bug reports, and feature requests, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sh951011/PyTorch-Seq2seq/issues) on Github.  
or Contacts sh951011@gmail.com please.
  
I appreciate any kind of feedback or contribution.  Feel free to proceed with small issues like bug fixes, documentation improvement.  For major contributions and new features, please discuss with the collaborators in corresponding issues.  

### Code Style
I follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code style. Especially the style of docstrings is important to generate documentation.
